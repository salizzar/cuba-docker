cuba-docker
===========

A POC with Ruby Cuba micro framework &amp; Redis using Fig to orchestrate Docker containers. Requires Docker and Fig, obviously.

Feel free to clone and modify. :)

P.S.: Dockerfile uses my custom images created with [https://github.com/salizzar/dockerfiles](my personal repo). I created two Dockerfiles to test my images with this project.
